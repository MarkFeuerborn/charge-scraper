# charge-scraper

# This is a work-in-progress adaptation of existing MagPi scrapers for a newsroom application. Its endgoal implementation is to pull down .pdf files from a court website, scan them for a list of charges of interest as keywords, and then send an email alert to the newsroom when it finds them. The project is still in its early stage, but is lightweight enough to work on a simple Raspberry Pi 1 Model B running Raspbian, and could be applied to any number of websites holding data of interest to journalists.

# This has been built for Python 3x
